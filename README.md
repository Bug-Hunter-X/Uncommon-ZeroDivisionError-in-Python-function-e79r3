This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python where a ZeroDivisionError might occur due to a subtle oversight in the conditionals of the code.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` offers a corrected version. This error highlights the importance of carefully examining all possible division scenarios, especially when dealing with user input or potentially zero values.
